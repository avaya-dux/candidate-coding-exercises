# Candidate Coding Exercises

This repository provides a few small exercises to familiarize you with the type of work that we do as developers on the UX Team, and for us to learn how you would solve a given task.

Each folder in this repository has a unique problem that will engage your skills in a different manner. In each, you will find an index or README with further instructions. Pick one to complete fully. If you want to pick a second one, go ahead, but **do not spend more than four hours in total on this task**.

## To submit your work
- fork this repository
- create a branch off of `main` in _your_ forked repository
- complete your work in that branch
- open a Pull Request (PR) from your branch into `main` _in your own repository_
- provide a link to that PR

## Quick tips
- ensure that your PR has a good description and includes any information needed to run your completed task
- if you need clarification, please do not hesitate to ask
- treat this as if it were a task given to you at work; you can use google/stackoverflow/whichever, but the code _must_ be your own
- if you complete a task fully, start a second, but are unable to complete the second in the four hour time limit, that is fine, just note it in the description of the PR
